# 🧐 What is this?

This small project is an over-engineered "Hello World" app using the MVC pattern. It's written in
Swift using UIKit but omitting the use of Storyboard (programmatic UI).

# 🏃 Run it

1. Change the Singing Team and Bundle Identifier in the Xcode project
2. Build the app on your device or a simulator
